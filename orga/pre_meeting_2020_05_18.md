Standup General:
- I would like to keep the standup structure, I know it from work and it works quite well.
- I would like to split it for our meeting in two groups (Standup Webbots/Controller & Backend)
- Everybody takes 1 minute to talk about what they did last week, what are they working on right now and what they have planned for the next week. Not more not less, you can clarify upcoming questions but please don't go too much in detail!
- Both groups give an overview like this and answer upcoming questions.
Review Milestone Presentation:
- Per and Wladimir give us short feedback on their Milestone presentation (Their feeling, what was good, what could be improved and what tips they can give us for the next one).
