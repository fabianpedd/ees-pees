Protocol for 1st Meeting on 27.04
- Introduction
- First Milestone Presentation due on 17.05 will be done by Per and Wladimir
    - Includes some Background on Safe Reinforcement Learning (What it is, Roughly how it is done)
    - The Project Goals and when they are planned to be reached
    - What tools/programs/IDE's we decide to use
    - Algorithms we plan to use
    - What Ideas we have for the Project
- Project Management Roles where distributed as following:
    - Time Manager: Per
    - Technical Manager: Fabian
    - Integration Manager: Wladimir, Jonas
    - Quality Manager: Shanshan, Rui, Mats
- It was decided to use following tools and programs:
    - For communication: Slack (including a channel to communicate with Willie)
    - Code Repository: Github, if a private repo is possible, else Gitlab
    - IDE for Coding: further discussion needed to get everyones preferences, for now
        Visual Studio Code (for C/C++/Python) or Atom + a Python IDE where suggested
    - Ticket System: Notion, or if Gitlab is used for the repository, we might use it for Tickets aswell
    - Webots for robot and enviroment simulation
- Following Tasks are due for next weeks meeting
    - Set up aforementioned Tools
    - First tryouts with Webots Tinkerbot modules
    - Read papers from Project Slides
        Concrete Problems in AI Safety: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.06565.pdf
        Benchmarking Safe Exploration in Deep RL: https://d4mucfpksywv.cloudfront.net/safexp-short.pdf
        (Optional) Algorithms for Reinforcement Learning:           https://sites.ualberta.ca/~szepesva/papers/RLAlgsInMDPs.pdf
    - Complete Project Managment Lesson on ISIS if not yet done
- Roles for the Project where distributed (though might change during project, depending on workload)
    - Neural Network: Mats, Per, Rui, Shanshan
    - Webots Simulator: Wladimir, Shanshan
    - External Controller: Fabian, Jonas
- As Languages Python for the Neural Network, C/C++ For the rest
The next Meeting on Mon. 04.05 at 11am, Fabian was chosen as the Moderator and Wladimir as Minute-taker
