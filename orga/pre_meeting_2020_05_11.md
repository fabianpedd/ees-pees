   * Project goal: Explicit declaration like setting up an environement to train and test a safe RL robot?
      * Get a robot and neural net working
      * Interface robot and neural net
      * Automate the training
      * Improve details
      (* increase difficulty)
   * Time management: Long time planning with deadlines? Use a Gantt-graph?
   * Usage of Notion?
   * Documentation: Everyone should document their work so that everyone has a better understanding of the whole project later

* Backend:
   * Safe requirements: No contact -> How should this be transferred to the agent or caught by the external controller ("safe circle")?
   * What should the reward function look like?
      * Time constraints?
      * Fixed velocity?

* Controller:
   * Failsafe:
      * Packet loss
      * Corrupted packages
       -> timeout?
      * Hardcoded "safe circle"?
   * Controller also for DSP funcionality?
   * Final interface definition?

* Webots:
   * Supervisor needs premium edition of Webots (concerning the training environement)
   * Lidar use: easy reduction in resolution if needed
   * Which robot design should be used?
