# EES-PEES Robot Project Backend Research
This folder includes old notebooks from our first research phase for a suitable algorithm to solve the fakeenvironment and after that the webots environment.

DISCLAIMER: 
The code is not refactored, covered by testcases or in any way part of our final solution to the goals of the project. The code also includes most of the time not our own code base but code from open source repositories from the internet. We used them to understand the underlying algorithms better and create first tests to run them on our own fakeenvironment. The notebooks are here only listed to understand better which learning path we took from the begin of the course until the final submission
